                      Copy

Default copy constructor
we do not define used defined copy constructor then compiler itself creates default copy constructor
Studen S1
Student S2=S1  // calling default copy construtor


implicit copy assignment operator
If you dont copy the one object to another object at time of creation then copy will be 
through assignment operator instead of default copy constructor

Student S1,S2;
S2=S1 // Calling copy assignment operator

Shallow copy

default copy constructor and copy assignment operator is shallow copy

Deep Copy
It will need when you have data member that have dynamically created and you want 
to copy the one object data to another object then you need to define user define copy 
constructor.
