1. Scope resulation Operator
   Returntype   class_name:: Function_name()
  -> Used to define the member function outside the class

2. Inline Member function
     declaration and defination of member function is within a class.Normally we do when 
     there is small body of the function otherwise we do defination outside the class by using 
    scope resulation operator

    Performance: 
      The compiler does many things when the function calls like
       -> match the passing argument list
      -> store the return address of the function
   So when we make the function inline then it ignores all these things and replace the function 
   statment where the function call instead of doing to match and store the address of the
   function

   The compiler consider the function inline if it is hardly consisted on one or two simple 
  statment otherwise not even you make it inline .
     To make function you can use inline keyword before the function return type of the function
     
  
3. Constructors
    -> Automatically call on object creation ,No return type,Name of the class
  Types:
         Default Cosntructor:
               -> Takes no argument, if not defined then compiler impilcitly defined.
         OverLoaded Constructor:
               -> Passing argument constructor
              -> can be overload many constructors with following manner
                        --> constructor with number of different parameters
                       -->  Constructor with changing sequence of parametrs with diff datatypes

         Constructor with default argument
              -> we can set the default value of the arguments
             -> able to create object with intializing with default value
            -> Its also known as default constructor

4. Classes with No Default Constructor

When all of a classâ€™s constructors require arguments, then the class does not have a default 
constructor. In such a case you must pass the required arguments to the constructor when 
creating an object. Otherwise, a compiler error will result. 

5. Destructors
     -> automatically call when object goes out of scope
     -> used to release  the memory from dynamic variables
      -> no return type ,used ~(tilde) sign ,name same as name of the class
     -> There is just one destructor in a class
6. Function Overloading:
        --> A function having arguments
       
      Default argument function:
            -> can have default arguments

    Only One Default Constructor and One Destructor:
When an object is defined without an argument list for its constructor, the compiler automatically calls the default constructor. For this reason, a class may have only one default 
constructor. If there were more than one constructor that could be called without an argument, the compiler would not know which one to call by default. 
Remember, a constructor whose parameters all have a default argument is considered a 
default constructor. It would be an error to create a constructor that accepts no parameters 
along with another constructor that has default arguments for all its parameters. In such a 
case the compiler would not be able to resolve which constructor to execute. 
Classes may also only have one destructor. Because destructors take no arguments, the 
compiler has no way to distinguish different destructors.
